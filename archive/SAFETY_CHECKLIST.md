# Safety Checklist for Peptide Analysis Pipeline

## Pre-Analysis Validation ‚úÖ

### Data Validation
- [ ] Check that input DataFrame is not empty
- [ ] Verify required columns exist ('peptide', condition columns)
- [ ] Validate that condition columns contain only numeric values
- [ ] Check for and handle missing/null values
- [ ] Verify peptide sequences contain only valid amino acids
- [ ] Ensure peptide sequences meet minimum length requirements

### Experimental Design Validation  
- [ ] Confirm both Control and Experiment conditions are specified
- [ ] Validate sufficient replicates (‚â•2 recommended per condition)
- [ ] Check for balanced experimental design
- [ ] Verify condition column names match DataFrame columns

### Parameter Validation
- [ ] Ensure CPM threshold is non-negative
- [ ] Validate minimum sample count is reasonable
- [ ] Check regex pattern syntax is valid
- [ ] Verify motif length is appropriate for peptide lengths
- [ ] Validate clustering parameters (number of clusters ‚â§ sequences)

## During Analysis Monitoring üìä

### Memory and Performance
- [ ] Monitor memory usage for large datasets
- [ ] Track processing time for each step
- [ ] Log warnings for suspicious data patterns
- [ ] Check for infinite loops or hanging processes

### Statistical Validity
- [ ] Verify library sizes are adequate for normalization
- [ ] Check for zero variance features
- [ ] Validate DESeq2 assumptions are met
- [ ] Monitor convergence of clustering algorithms

### Data Quality Checks
- [ ] Track percentage of peptides lost at each filtering step
- [ ] Monitor distribution of count data
- [ ] Check for batch effects or systematic biases
- [ ] Validate that significant results are biologically plausible

## Post-Analysis Validation üîç

### Results Quality
- [ ] Verify clustering produces meaningful groups
- [ ] Check that sequence logos are interpretable
- [ ] Validate differential expression statistics
- [ ] Ensure adequate number of significant peptides

### Output Integrity
- [ ] Confirm all plots are generated successfully
- [ ] Verify data exports are complete and uncorrupted
- [ ] Check that results are reproducible with same parameters
- [ ] Validate cross-references between different result components

## Error Handling Requirements ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Critical Errors (Stop Analysis)
- Empty input data
- Missing required columns
- Invalid regex patterns  
- Insufficient data for statistical analysis
- Memory allocation failures

### Warnings (Continue with Caution)
- High proportion of invalid sequences
- Unbalanced experimental design  
- Low library sizes
- Poor clustering convergence
- Unusual data distributions

### Recovery Strategies
- Automatic parameter adjustment when possible
- Graceful degradation (e.g., simpler analysis methods)
- Clear error messages with suggested fixes
- Preservation of partial results when analysis fails

## Future Run Safety Measures üõ°Ô∏è

### If Results Look Suspicious
1. Re-run analysis with same parameters
2. Check data preprocessing steps
3. Validate against known positive controls
4. Consider alternative analysis methods

### If System Performance Degrades
1. Monitor memory and CPU usage
2. Reduce dataset size or complexity
3. Restart analysis components
4. Consider distributed computing options
